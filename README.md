Odin Project 1: Recipe website

This is a directory of some good recipes from the Book 'Salt, Fat Acid Heat' by Samin Nosrat

This includes:
- Bright Cabbage Slaw (pg 224)
- Vegetable Pasta with Broccoli and Bread Crumbs (pg 295)
- Basic Salsa Verde (pg360)

After completing this, it will show my competency with:
- Managing documents on Git, a version control system
- Implementing headers, paragraphs, lists, images and links on a website
